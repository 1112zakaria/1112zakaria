### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I like to code. And I like to play footy and volleyball. Cats are cool too.

I do not like leetcode. It hurts my head :(

I like C++ and C. Golang is pretty cool, I think its concurrency constructs are pretty nutty.

I currently go to Carleton University and I am in the Software Engineering program. It's not too bad. I am in my last year and I'm hoping that it stays that way.

I enjoy systems programming and find it very fun. So far, I have interned on teams involved in various areas in the telecommunications sector, including but not limited to traffic engineering, SD-WAN, and 5G NR. These experiences have been very invaluable for me; the people that I've worked with were superb and I got to learn lots from them.

I like to tinker around with tools sometimes.
